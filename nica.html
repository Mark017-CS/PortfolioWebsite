            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm a 20-year-old Pisces computer science student who enjoys cosplay and watching movies. My love for technology and the creative aspect of cosplay come hand in hand, as I enjoy designing costumes and learning new makeup techniques. I also enjoy exploring new stories and worlds through movies, finding it fascinating how they transport us to different places and times.
            As someone who enjoys connecting with people, I love hearing their stories and learning from their perspectives. It's something that brings me joy, whether it's talking about coding techniques or debating the merits of a particular film.            
            Despite the challenges, I'm passionate about my computer science course and constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge. Overall, I'm someone who loves to learn, explore, and connect with others, and I'm excited about where my passions and interests will take me in the future.</p>

                <h3>Yarnwork</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about crochet and love creating new patterns and designs. One thing I've learned about crochet is that it requires a lot of patience and attention to detail, just like coding. Both activities demand focus and persistence to achieve the desired outcome. As I work on a new project, I find that my ability to stay calm and patient is key to achieving success, whether I'm working with yarn or lines of code.</p>

                    <p>Our computer application project is designed to tackle food waste and its harmful impact on the environment. The app manages food items by tracking their expiry dates, reducing food waste and preventing spoilage. Users can easily input their food inventory and receive notifications when an item is about to expire. Our app provides tips on how to extend the shelf life of certain foods and suggests recipes based on the items available. Join us in the fight against food waste and make a positive impact on the environment with our innovative application.</p>

                    <p>This is a red and white strawberry sling bag that I made during my downtime from coding. Crocheting has been a great way to relax and unwind after long hours of coding, allowing my brain to breathe and think about possible solutions to any bugs in my code. This cute and functional strawberry sling bag is perfect for carrying my essentials and adds a pop of color to any outfit. With its unique design and practicality, it's quickly become one of my favorite accessories.</p>
